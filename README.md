# SYSC5001

This repository was created to hold various tools I wrote for the class SYSC5001: Simulation and Modelling, taken at Carleton University. The course focused on discrete-event system simulation and queueing theory, but included examples using Monte Carlo methods as well as a significant review of stochastic processes. Some of the tools here (notably the queue simulators) are incomplete and/or non-functional, but maybe someone else will find them useful when working on similar assignments in the future.
